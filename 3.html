            As much as I love the anime as a whole, I mostly came here to rave about its unique and incredibly visually-stunning art style. Many anime of the current age is full of shoddy 3D animation that has taken over the market. So this is a refreshing piece which I welcome with open arms. With its unique character designs, fluid action sequences, and gorgeous landscapes, weaving a tapestry of eye-gasmic beauty!

            While Demon Slayer is full of well executed plot points, so far at 7 episodes there has been a disappointing level of character development. Thus far, Tanjirou's (the protagonist) only known traits is his determination, his protective nature of his younger sister, and his good natured spirit. These character qualities can be seen in any number of action-oriented shows, and given the unfortunate circumstance of Nezuko Kamado (Tanjirou’s sister), her character will probably be relegated to an ‘unforeseen’ plot twist to stymie Tanjirou in his quest. A quest that feels somewhat predictable given Tanjirou’s motivations; however, an exciting one, nonetheless.

            All in all, this is a beautiful anime with an intense amount of action. And I don't mean intense as in nonstop, but given the rather dark side of the underlying plot, it is rather in a fashion where you can feel a tension accumulate and surge up as Tanjirou moves from one challenge to the next. But I love that this series gives an appropriate amount of time spent on each of those challenges; it neither needlessly draws any sequence out with unnecessary "white noise", nor does it cut anything short, but rather has a good flow of the story line as a whole. I recommend everyone give this one a try! And did I say it is gorgeously animated yet?
