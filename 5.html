            Look, when I first learned about this show I was mega hyped. The character designs were really freaking cool, the production was top notch, and the whole base concept and design of these kickass fire fighters who fight fire with FREAKING FIRE! It was just straight up - HELL YEAH!
            <br>
            <br>
            However... After a full 13 episodes I must say, not only did it not live up to the hype, it just isn't that great in general. What this show has going for it is all the outside stuff like the stuff I mentioned above as well as some very well choreographed fights scenes and such. But at the end of the day this show is devastatingly lacking in character and story depth. The characters and their motivation all feel so shallow because the story doesn't properly build up their background to allow it's viewers to really empathize with them.
            <br>
            <br>
            To sum it up this show is like a very beautiful woman who hardly has anything going for her aside from her physical appearance. Still worth watching, but don't expect too much aside from the visuals and concepts.
