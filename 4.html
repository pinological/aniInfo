            One Piece is a classic, the anime has lasted over 13 years, why has it lasted so long?
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the reasons is the characters, all of the characters have a touching backstory, you get attached to them and want them to succeed. They help people, they joke around, they struggle, they grow, the characters are truly what makes One Piece a show you want to watch.
            <br>
            <br>
            The story is another reason people continue to watch it, who hasn't dreamed of adventure and exploring? He wants to be pirate king and because of that he gets to meet people and have fun and change the world. He's not stuck abiding by the law when the law is wrong, he does what is right and that leads to a lot of trouble often. But we cheer him on because he's doing the right thing, much like people like Batman, he does what is right in his own way.

            The battles are another reason One Piece has continued so long, Oda comes up with fantastic Devil Fruit powers, which lead to thrilling fights. Sometimes the abilities are silly, other times they are just plain terrifying. Seeing how Luffy and the crew deal with their new adversaries and try to save people, makes the show so addictive to watch.

            Now that I've covered some of the good things about the series, I will mention the cons.

The series starts off with a lackluster art style, as expected for most older anime shows, the characters (definitely not talking about Ussop /sarcasm) can be annoying at times, and there is the typical anime fact there is always a stronger opponent. Basically if you like shonen anime, you will probably like this show, if you like more mature and serious anime (seinen anime) then this probably won't be for you.
