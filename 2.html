            FAIRY TAIL is an anime series about a teen named Lucy (voiced by Cherami Leigh) who runs away with her new friend, Natsu (Todd Haberkorn), to join the well-known wizards guild, Fairy Tail. Natsu is a powerful wizard endowed with rare fire magic who's on a quest to find his foster parent, a dragon named Igneel who disappeared years ago. Lucy's powers are celestial, allowing her to summon spirits to help her in times of need. Together with Natsu's cat, Happy (Tia Ballard), the two face one adventure after another, battling evil wizards and attacks from new foes at every turn.<br>

                Fairy Tail appeals to anime fans, thanks to a plot that's layered with curious characters, legends, and a story that evolves at a believable pace rather than all at once. It's more complex than most, and the characters run the gamut of personality styles, which helps keep things interesting. Both Lucy and Natsu have positive qualities that make them decent protagonists as well.

But what the show has an excess of is content that's not suited to the kids who typically seek out anime series. Violence is the norm in this genre, but Fairy Tail's is even more prevalent than its peers'. Even more noticeable is the show's rather questionable portrayal of women, whose physical attributes (busty chests, thin frames, and accentuated curves) get more attention than their abilities do, and who often have less upstanding characteristics (apparent alcoholism and a bad case of popularity envy, to name a couple) than do their male counterparts. The bottom line? Its story is well developed and will keep viewers' interest, but the mature content is better suited to teens than to kids.
